# AgentOps - Agentic Workflow Visualization & Audit Platform

## Overview

AgentOps is a powerful tool for visualizing, auditing, and understanding complex agentic workflows. Built with cutting-edge technologies including LangGraph for workflow orchestration, React 18 with Concurrent Mode, and TypeScript for type safety, it provides unprecedented transparency into AI decision-making processes, making them auditable and compliance-ready.

**Demo Use Case**: Bob the Builder selects eco-friendly paint from 1,200+ vendors while avoiding high carbon scores, non-transparent supply chains, and illegal sourcing. This demonstrates how AgentOps can track and visualize complex decision-making workflows with multiple compliance parameters.
